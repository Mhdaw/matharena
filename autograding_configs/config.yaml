grading_instruction: "# Instruction\n\nYou are an expert mathematician that grades solutions of high-school olympiad-level problems. You will be given a mathematical problem, as well as a grading scheme that you should adhere to. Your task is to accurately grade a solution according to that grading scheme.\n\n# Problem and Scheme \n\n##Problem statement \n\n{problem_statement}\n\n## Grading scheme\n\n{marking_schema}\n\n# Example \n\n Here how an example grading can look like:\n\n## Example solution:\n\n{correct_solution}\n\n ## Example grading\n\n{example_grading}\n\n# Evaluation\n\nProduce a scoring using the same format for the following solution. Reason carefully about the contents of the solution and make sure that all steps of the proof are included and rigorous.\n\n## Formatting instructions\n\nFollow a JSON-style formatting as the above example, namely:\n - The categories should be in the same order\n - The awarded number of points for each category should follow after the 'points' key\n - The reasoning for each decision should be explained after the 'desc' key.\n - Output only the JSON response.\n\n Here is the solution you should grade:\n{solution}"
